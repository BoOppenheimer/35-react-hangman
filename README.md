This was written 2020'ish for a game class at Berkeley, was thinking it would go more into the canvas etc but turned out to be React. About the same time as React 16x and hooks. So well worth the lessons in hooks. Hail hail React, long live React. 💪🏻 
## possiable other features

- [ ] click and show definition of word?
- [ ] show simular meaning words? Theasauras?...
- [ ] Perhaps the words can be coming from a crossword puzzle api? Or dictonary api?
